# 🛡 Cybersecurity Journey & TryHackMe Notes  

This repository documents my journey into *cybersecurity*.  
I’m currently learning through *TryHackMe, while also preparing for certifications like **ISC2 CC* and *CompTIA Security+*.  

Here you’ll find:  
- 📘 Notes from TryHackMe rooms (Pre-Security, Cybersecurity 101, SOC Level 1, etc.)  
- 📝 Summaries of key networking, Linux, and security concepts  
- ⚡ Cheat sheets and commands for quick reference  
- 🔐 My progress as I work towards a SOC role and beyond  

This repo is both my *study resource* and a way to *share knowledge with others* who are also starting their cybersecurity journey.
